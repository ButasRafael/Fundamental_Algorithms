# Fundamental_Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of essential algorithms in data structures and graph theory, including sorting, searching, traversal, and optimization algorithms. Each algorithm is optimized and profiled using profiler.h to track performance metrics, such as comparisons and assignments, and in some cases, execution time.
